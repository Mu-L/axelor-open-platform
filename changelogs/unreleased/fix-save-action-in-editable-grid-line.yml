title: Fix handle save action in editable grid line
type: fix
description: |
  When a "save" action occurs from a button inside an grid line, the save is now handle by the main record
  whatever if the grid is in edit or non-edit mode. It also ensure data integrity and correct state updates.
  The following sequence occurs :

  1. In case of non-edit grid mode, trigger the onChange of the current field, if any input is currently 
  focused and value changed.
  2. Trigger the onClick action of the button to update the line data.
  3. As soon as a "save" action is detected, commit the line to trigger the onChange of the relational field.
  4. Finally, the save action of the main record is triggered with the updated grid data.
  5. Continue any pending action after the save.
  
  It is not recommended to update the record after the save. action-view/report/validate can still occurs.
