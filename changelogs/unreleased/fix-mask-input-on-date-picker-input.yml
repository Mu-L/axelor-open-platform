title: Fix mask input on date picker input
type: fix
description: |
  On widgets using a mask (date/time,...), previously adding characters causes existing characters to advance. And 
  deleting characters causes existing characters to move back. Now adding or deleting characters will not affect the 
  positions of existing characters.
  
  On date/datetime, it also validates date parts (days/months/years) for valid inputs.
