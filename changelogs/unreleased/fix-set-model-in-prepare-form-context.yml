title: Fixes how the form context is prepared
type: fix
description : |
  The way from context was prepared was creating issues. The form context is a concatenation of the action view 
  context values and the view/record values. But it was created in the wrong order : instead of appending view/record 
  context values first and then the action view context values, it is now the reverse. The view/record context values 
  should be priority over action view context values.
  
  Means that if passing some data in action view context that can have the same names as the view/record context 
  values, the latter will have priority.
  
  This fixes an issue with chart/search views search-field requests : the model was coming from the action view instead 
  of the form itself. In case of chart and search views (without `search-form`), the model is by default 
  `com.axelor.script.ScriptBindings`.
