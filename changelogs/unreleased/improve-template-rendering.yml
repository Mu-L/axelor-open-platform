title: Improve template rendering
type: feature
description : |
  Previously, the React template component was being remounted entirely whenever the record context changed.
  This caused visible UI flicker and unnecessary teardown/re-initialization of the component,
  even when only the record data was updated.
  
  This fix ensures that the template component now mounts only once, and instead of remounting,
  it will re-render efficiently in response to changes in the record context. This preserves component in dom by react 
  and eliminates the flicker, resulting in a smoother user experience during form changes.
  
  This impacts all fields viewers, label/static/help widgets, fields tooltip, kanban/cards/calendar/custom views.
